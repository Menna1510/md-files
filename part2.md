Dear Reader

Islam is a complete and integral Divine religion and way of life. It has a complete code of ethics for a happy life, as well as a peaceful and tranquil life after death. Islam is free from all imperfections and defects. Any deviant or abnormal behavior observed in a Muslim should have no bearing on Islam, none whatsoever. The reason for such deviant behavior is generally a poor understanding of the faith, and in other cases, weak faith that leads to the person going astray from what is proper and noble. It is unjust and unreasonable for Islam to be assessed or evaluated based on any individuals' behavior or attitudes, with the exception of the Prophet Muhammad, who is the best example and role model for all humans.

All praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds, the Creator of the heavens and earth and all creatures living in them. May God grant peace and blessings to Prophet Muhammad, God's final Messenger, whose message brought mercy to all mankind. May He also give His blessings to all the prophets and messengers whom He sent to guide mankind out of darkness and into light.

At the Osoul Centre for Islamic Advocacy, every new release that we produce gives us a great opportunity to interact with our readers. All our releases have the same overall objective; to present Islam to mankind, as it truly is. We aim to make people aware of Islam's fine aspects and profound teachings and to show clearly that it is the only faith that provides practical and effective solutions to all the problems faced by humanity.

Islam gives clear and solid answers to all of the questions that have troubled people over many generations, such as: How did we come into existence and why do we exist? Where do we go from here? Furthermore, Islam is the only religion that requires its followers to love and respect all the prophets God sent, particularly Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them both). We take great care to provide solid and rational proofs for our arguments, so as to give our readers the reassurance they need, and our releases also refute the accusations levelled against Islam and provide clarification to people's misunderstandings of Islamic teachings.

By God's grace, Islam is the fastest growing religion in our time, as confirmed by a study undertaken by the Pew Research Center(1), and our motive is to make this great divine faith known to all people.

This book, Jesus in the Qur'an, speaks first about people's need to receive the divine message through prophets. They need this as much as they need food and drink to survive, if not more. God's messengers and prophets were assigned the task of giving people the right concept of God, their Creator, and explaining to them how to earn His pleasure and acceptance, and how to avoid incurring His anger. They put all this into practice so that their teachings would serve as a code by which to live, setting human life on the right course and ensuring their happiness in the life to come.

The author relates the story of Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him), starting at a point well before his birth, when his virtuous mother was pregnant. He then reports the circumstances of his birth and speaks about Jesus's message and the opposition he had to endure. The author then discusses the Qur'anic account of Jesus, which makes clear that he enjoys a very high position with God Almighty.

We hope that readers will find this book useful in adding to their knowledge and understanding of Islam.
